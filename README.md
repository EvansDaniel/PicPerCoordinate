This application is being built to map the hiking trails of our university,
Sewanee: The University of the South. It will record the coordinates of the
trails and take pictures of the trail programmatically.

It's creation is a necessity to build our next application SewaneeMaps, which
will provide detailed location and direction data for the user while they
are hiking in Sewanee. The pictures taken by this app will provide an immersive
"street view" preview of each trail in the SewaneeMaps application. Our belief is that
the data collected by this app and provided in the SewaneeMaps application will help
make Sewanee a safer place to hike and enjoy
 
Finally, each installation of the SewaneeMaps application we come with a full map of
each hiking trail in Sewanee so as to curb the threat of losing service in the wilderness
